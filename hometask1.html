        <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "white">Natural disasters are caused due to different reasons like soil erosion, seismic activity, tectonic movements, air pressure, and ocean currents etc. Some examples of natural disasters are tornadoes, hurricanes, twisters, blizzards, sandstorms, snowstorms, avalanches, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. An amazing fact about natural disasters is that the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean is known to consist 90 percent of the total 1900 active volcanoes all over the world. Now, isn't that amazing? </font> <br> <br>
        <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "white">Natural disasters can be a a huge, bad change. It can wreck skyscrapers, houses, etc. As well, it is natural, not human-controlled, so you can't stop it. Though, you can still defend yourself. As an example, when there is an earthquake going on, shut your houses or go indoors and hide under a table, chair or anything like that to not let the earthquake damage your body, especially your head. If something happens to your head, dangerous incedents can happen. Another example is that if there is a flood coming up and the weather station knows, they will present that on internet, as well as what to do to defend ourselves from such danger. The weather station will inform the governemnt on what is about to happen and the government and workers will take action.</font> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <font size = "18" face = "Ink Free" color = "#00FFBF">What can I do if I am in a city with skyscrapers and an earthquake is about to come up?</font> <br> 
        <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "white">There is a high chance of skyscrapers falling on your neighborhood, but you can evacuate and inform other people to do the same thing. But, you may want to protect your house. You know that there is a natural disaster coming your way and you want to protect you, your family (if you have one) and your house. You can strap ovens and refrigerators to the walls, use latches to keep cabinet doors from flying open during an earthquake and anchor heavy mirrors and pictures over chairs, and couches with wire through eye screws into studs. This will help protect your house. Workers will help people inside the skyscrapers get out of it before the skyscrapers start to rumble. The government will help citizens survive the natural disaster.</font> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <font size = "18" face = "Ink Free" color = "#00FFBF">The weather station told us that a tornado is heading our way</font> <br>
        <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "white">Tornadoes occur more frequently in the United States than in any other country in the world. There are approximately 1,200 tornadoes here each year! You will feel scared, but the weather station / government usually tells how to survive this natural disaster. If you are at home, seek shelter in the bottommost floor, and innermost area, such as an inner hallway, bathroom, or closet. Stay away from windows, outer walls, and building corners. Do not waste time opening windows. If you have a basement, go down there and you will stay safe. Overall, a skyscraper-like any other buildings or house is not a safe place when a tornado hits. Because the truth is, it canâ€™t break the wind that it produces. But the only thing you need to do to survive is to stay away from any glass windows. Many hotels have large glass windows on the outer walls of the guest rooms, posing a great risk of flying, broken glass. If a tornado seems imminent, move out of the room and seek a safe room in the hotel basement if time permits, or take a blanket for cover and retreat to an inside hallway. </font> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <font size = "18" face = "Ink Free" color = "#00FFBF">I see a hurricane hurdling towards my city</font> <br>
        <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "white">Follow these tips for staying safe in your home during a hurricane : Stay inside and away from windows, skylights, and glass doors. If flooding threatens your home , turn off electricity at the main breaker. If you lose power, turn off major appliances such as the air conditioner and water heater to reduce damage. If you are starting to feel unsafe in a high-rise office or condo, go to the stairwell. Staircases in buildings are reinforced with concrete walls, making them the spine of the building. During a hurricane, the stairwell in a tall building is the safest place to be. Most importantly, if a storm is coming and you are ordered to evacuate, do so. Following a serious storm, you may be without power. If you have limited kitchen space, store items under beds, in closets or wherever necessary. Buy lots of drinking water in gallon jugs or plastic bottles. Fill your bathtubs with tap water. This is used for flushing toilets and washing if your water supply is damaged or cut off by the storm. Take refuge in a small interior room, closet, or hallway on the lowest level during the storm. Put as many walls between you and the outside as you can. Stay away from windows, skylights, and glass doors. These are some ways to stay safe in a hurricane.</font> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <font size = "18" face = "Ink Free" color = "#00FFBF">A sandstorm is about to occur and I am outside</font> <br>
        <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "white">The best way to beat a sandstorm is to wait it out. Stay indoors until the weather conditions clear up and only leave your house if need be. Staying inside a shelter will limit any unexpected dangers that might occur. This means you should go find a shelter before the storm comes. If you are outside, dangerous things could happen. As it sounds scary, there's nothing to be afraid of if you are indoors. The sandstorm isn't there yet, so go quickly and find some shelter for yourself. If you are at a location where there are rare shelters to find,  stay hydrated- fluids, especially water are just as important during sandstorms. Remember to keep hydrated or even spray water on face and eyes if you come in direct contact with dust.</font> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
        <font face = "Comic Sans MS" color = "purple">Natural Disasters occur naturally, so be prepared what comes your way. As I have told you how to survive a few natural disasters, you should be 10% more ready for your future natural disasters! :) I hope this website helped a lot!</font>
